What it does:

1. Lookup tags in Folksaurus.
2. Send PUT requests for ones that don't exist.
3. Save term information in wp_folksaurus_term_data and wp_folksaurus_term_relationships.
4. Automatically replace non-ambiguous non-preferred terms with their preferred terms.
5. Call attention to ambiguous terms somehow.
6. Set values of wp_term_taxonomy.parent.
